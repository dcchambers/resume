# Resume

I'm not actively looking for new work right now, but I'm always open to hear about fun opportunities and interesting challenges.

This is a living resume, written in markdown, and rendered into PDF with Pandoc!

This resume is stored in a git repository and the complete history of the document is freely available. It serves as both a public-facing resume and a convenient way for me to track what kind of work I have done over the years.

- [Single Page Resume (Markdown)](single-page-resume.md)
  - [Single Page Resume (PDF)](single-page-resume.pdf)
- [Long Form Resume (Markdown)](long-form-resume.md)
  - [Long Form Resume (PDF)](long-form-resume.md)

The files are generated with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
```
$ pandoc resume.md -o resume.pdf -V geometry:margin=1in
```
